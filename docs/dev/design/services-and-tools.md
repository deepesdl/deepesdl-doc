# DeepESDL Services and Tools

The Python [xcube](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/) Toolkit plays a core role 
in the DeepESDL’s system design. Here we briefly introduce the key 
components of xcube to provide an overview.

The **xcube generators** are command-line tools used 
to generate analysis-ready data cubes (ARDC) with inputs from one or 
more data stores. 

The **xcube Server** provides a web service that offers several RESTful APIs. 
It publishes collections of ARDCs which are provided by configurable data 
stores but also provides an OGC WMTS and time-series service. 

The **xcube Viewer** is a simple and very easy-to-use single-page web 
application that fully exploits the APIs offered by xcube Server. 

 **xcube Data Stores** are used by the xcube Generator and the xcube Server 
represent different data cube sources. 
 
Finally, the [xcube Python API](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) 
provides various high- and low-level functions for 
data analysis that operate on data cubes and comprises programmatic 
access to all other xcube Components mentioned above. 
Users call the Python API from their own programs, scripts, JNBs, 
or from user code executed in the `xcube gen2` generator. 
During the project, generic functions will be added to the Python API 
to support machine learning using the data cubes (see *ML Toolkit* below), 
as well as new use case specific functions as desired in the 
different DeepESDL user projects. 

## xcube Generators

The command-line tools 
[`xcube gen`](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/xcube_gen.html) and 
[`xcube gen2`](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/xcube_gen2.html)
offer flexible data cube generation 
that is made available via a dedicated [JupyterLab](../guide/jupyterlab.md) 
profile. The tool reads data streams from one or more data stores, 
then it resamples and combines them. The merged cube can then be 
manipulated by user-provided Python code before the resulting 
cube is written into another data store, for example AWS S3.

The current features of the xcube generation service are:

* Read data streams from a variety of xcube data stores
  (see [xcube Toolkit](./services-and-tools.md)).
* Perform spatial resampling of raw and rectified data streams to 
  a common spatial grid using standard coordinate reference systems, e.g., 
  EU LAEA (EPSG:3035).
* Perform temporal resampling by aggregating observations to equally 
  sized time periods, e.g., 8-day averages. 
* Merge resampled data streams into a single cube, optionally 
  passing it to user Python code for further value adding or transformation.
* Write chunked data cube into remote object storage or the 
  local file system.


## xcube Server

The xcube Server 
([`xcube serve`](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/xcube_serve.html))
offers a web service that publishes collections of 
data cubes which are provided by configurable xcube data stores. 
It offers a RESTful API for browsing the published cubes (catalogue), 
for multi-resolution image tiles (OCG-compliant WMTS, later WCS), 
for time-series retrieval, and for direct data access. 
Moreover, it will be equipped with a STAC-compatible catalogue API that 
supports spatial OpenSearch requests. 

The xcube Server will be extended to fully support any new 
xcube Viewer features, for example linking the geoDB with 
xcube Server and Viewer.

## xcube Viewer

The xcube Viewer 
([`xcube-viewer`](https://github.com/xcube-dev/xcube-viewer))
is a simple and very easy-to-use single-page web application 
that fully exploits the APIs offered by xcube Server. It displays the 
spatial images of the data cubes on a map at given time steps,
it can show a variable’s time series with error bars for any geometry and 
show the details of a data cubes and its variables.

![xcube Viewer](../img/xcube-viewer-2.png)

The xcube Viewer provides several useful tools to explore data cubes. 
For example:

* Open any number of data cubes and display spatial images of dataset 
  variables on a map.
* Open places (vector data) associated with data cubes and display them.
* Show detailed information about selected data cubes, data variables 
  and places.
* Select places or let users draw shapes and display time series with 
  error bars.
* Click into time series to show corresponding images in map.
* Start a “player” that steps through time and animates the map and time  
  indicator in time series diagrams accordingly.
* Download extracted time series data.

During the DeepESDL project, the xcube Viewer will be enhanced by 
new features such as:

* Switching between 2D map display and 3D globe displays.
* Multiple, possibly synchronized 2D/3D displays and split-view displays.
* Generate new data variables on-the-fly from user-supplied Python functions.
  Code may originate from shared locations on GitHub or may be provided
  inline by a simple code editor.

## xcube Data Stores

Data store implementations are 
dynamically registered in the **xcube Data Store Framework**. 
The following data stores are already available

* ESA CCI Open Data Portal (from xcube plugin [xcube-cci](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-cci)).
* C3S Climate Data Store (from xcube plugin [xcube-cds](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-cds)).
* CMEMS Data Store (from xcube plugin [xcube-cmems](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-cmems)).
* Sentinel Hub (from xcube plugin [xcube-sh](https://github.com/dcs4cop/xcube-sh)).
* Generic data stores such as S3-compatible object storage (`s3`), 
  local file system (`file`), and in-memory (`memory`).

Its is planned to develop data stores for the **geoDB** service, 
so users can retrieve vector datasets and rasterized vector data 
sources as gridded ARDCs. 
Other data stores that are needed by DeepESDL Projects will be added 
as required by specific use cases during the project.


## ML Toolkit

The DeepESDL ML Toolkit is a small and handy 
Python package that provides useful functions for machine learning tasks
with DeepESDL data cubes.

The toolkit is made available as a DeepESDL JupyterLab environment (profile), 
and includes popular libraries such as **scikit learn**, **TensorFlow**, 
**Keras**, and **PyTorch**.

To support model evaluation during training, the ready-to-use processing
environment is also extended by a **TensorBoard** to support the tracking of
individual experiments and training runs.
This tool can be used with PyTorch and TensorFlow, and it provides 
a state-of-the-art toolset for data scientist to inspect the tuning 
and training process and compare metrics.

The toolkit offers the following:

* Adapters are provided to existing data loading and transformation 
  mechanisms from Keras and PyTorch (`DataGenerator`, `DataLoader`) 
  to be usable for the DeepESDL data cubes. 

* Implementations of sampling mechanisms and online repartitioning methods 
  suited for the data cube files which are stored in chunks. 
  This element is essential, as it enables deep learning that respects 
  the basic principles of geo data way beyond naive applications of
  machine learning in the Earth system context. 

To ease adoption by scientist we plan to also develop script templates 
for common deep learning tasks such as autoencoder on time-series data, 
in particular physics informed autoencoder, transfer learning and change 
detection on time series.

The toolkit is currently for Python only, but Julia will also be 
considered to address a small but growing community of data scientists.
