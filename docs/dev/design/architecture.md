# DeepESDL Architecture

The following figure depicts the high-level concepts and the architecture 
of the DeepESDL project. It comprises the internal [*DeepESDL Hub*](hub.md) 
and *user projects* and the publicly visible parts. Both are served by a 
common infrastructure and common resources.

Applications available to users within DeepESDL comprise:

* An **xcube Catalogue** to browse available data, including a web page 
  that lists available datasets as a low-barrier entry point for users. 
  (In development, will be similar to the 
  [ESA EuroDataCube Collections](https://collections.eurodatacube.com/).) 
* Visualisation tools such as adapted versions of the **xcube Viewer** 
  and a **4D Viewer**.
* A **Jupyter Notebook (JNB) service** so that users can run 
  Jupyter Notebooks with project-specific **Machine Learning (ML) 
  environments**. 

Services available to users within DeepESDL comprise:

* An **xcube Server** to browse, access, and publish gridded data cubes.
* A **geoDB** instance to browse, access, and publish vector datasets. 
* A **Workspace** so projects can store and share any other data, 
  such as ML workflows. 
* Access to all shared and project-specific **Data Cubes** in object storage.

Each project has access to the DeepESDL common resources that comprise 
a cluster of worker nodes as well as a common 
**xcube ARDC Service**, that can access a variety of data 
access services and turns provided data into analysis-ready data cubes (ARDC).
DeepESDL data cubes share a consistent structure and use a uniform format. 

To enable efficient machine learning on data cubes, the ARDC Generator 
utilizes a configurable ML sampling module for training and validation. 
Likewise, the worker nodes offer GPU-acceleration for demanding ML training. 
Core libraries include Keras/Tensorflow and PyTorch and advanced 
tools for model evaluation like TensorBoard or MLflow are made available. 

The *DeepESDL Published Project Data* is backed by a subset of the 
applications and services granted to each 
project, that is, a common **xcube Server** and **geoDB** is provided
to serve the public catalogue and visualisation tools; 
a public **REST API** allows accessing the services programmatically. 
Public services will later also comprise a Jupyter Book  (JB) 
or Notebook Viewer  (NBviewer) service, so that selected Project-JNBs 
can be elaborated into published, story-telling books. 
This service together with catalogue and visualisations tools 
are important parts of the DeepESDL scientific information dissemination.

The numerous distributed services and applications of the DeepESDL system 
are containerized and are executed in a common cloud environment. 
To orchestrate, monitor, maintain, and scale the variety of 
DeepESDL services and applications, we use today’s most popular 
container orchestrator [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (K8s). 
This supports the idea that the DeepESDL system is deployable on any Cloud 
environment that can run a K8s service (this is, AWS, Google, 
Microsoft Azure, and many others including all DIAS instances). The 
initial system is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the EU-Central-1 
region, which is physically located in Frankfurt, Germany, Europe using the 
managed K8s service EKS, which is critical for cost-efficiency and 
reliability of DeepESDL. 

To be able to meet the ambitious requirements for the service, 
we must base the solution mainly on existing technologies. 
Many of the DeepESDL system components have been developed in former 
(mostly ESA) projects and are thus reused, adapted, extended, and branded 
for DeepESDL. Examples are

* DeepESDL Hub is based on EOxHub developed by EOX and used for
  example in the ESA EuroDataCube project;
* The xcube cube generator tools, xcube Server, xcube Viewer 
  are derived from already available components in the
  [xcube Toolkit](./services-and-tools.md) 
  developed and used in several activities by the development team;
* The Cube 4D Viewer will be an adopted version of Earthwave’s 4D Viewer.
