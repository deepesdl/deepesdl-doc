# Getting Started 

`ml4xcube` is a comprehensive Python-based toolkit designed for researchers and developers in the field of machine learning with an emphasis on `xarray` data cubes. This toolkit is engineered to provide specialized and robust support for data cube management and analysis, operating with the state-of-the-art machine learning libraries (1) `scikit-learn`, (2) `PyTorch` and (3) `TensorFlow`. 

## Installation

Get started with `ml4xcube` effortlessly by installing it directly through pip:
```bash
pip install ml4xcube
```
or conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ml4xcube
```
