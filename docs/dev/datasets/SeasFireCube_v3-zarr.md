| description | The RESOLVE Ecoregions dataset, updated in 2017, offers a depiction of the 846 terrestrial ecoregions that represent our living planet\.Ecoregions, in the simplest definition, are ecosystems of regional extent\. Specifically, ecoregions represent distinct assemblages of biodiversity\-all taxa, not just vegetation\-whose boundaries include the space required to sustain ecological processes\. Ecoregions provide a useful basemap for conservation planning in particular because they draw on natural, rather than political, boundaries, define distinct biogeographic assemblages and ecological habitats within biomes, and assist in representation of Earth's biodiversity\.This dataset is based on recent advances in biogeography \- the science concerning the distribution of plants and animals\. The original ecoregions dataset has been widely used since its introduction in 2001, underpinning the most recent analyses of the effects of global climate change on nature by ecologists to the distribution of the world's beetles to modern conservation planning\.The 846 terrestrial ecoregions are grouped into 14 biomes  |

Each MOD11C1 product consists of the following layers for daytime and nighttime observations: LSTs, quality control assessments, observation times, view zenith angles, number of clear\-sky observations, and emissivities from bands 20, 22, 23, 29, 31, and 32 \(bands 31 and 32 are daytime only\) along with the percentage of land in the grid |

It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level\. It is calculated over all surfaces \- land, sea and inland water\. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure weather systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones\. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind\. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds\. The units of this parameter are pascals \(Pa\)\. Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb \(1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa\)\. |

| description | The Arctic Oscillation \(AO\) is a large scale mode of climate variability, also referred to as the Northern Hemisphere annular mode\. The AO is a climate pattern characterized by winds circulating counterclockwise around the Arctic at around 55°N latitude\. When the AO is in its positive phase, a ring of strong winds circulating around the North Pole acts to confine colder air across polar regions\. This belt of winds becomes weaker and more distorted in the negative phase of the AO, which allows an easier southward penetration of colder, arctic airmasses and increased storminess into the mid\-latitudes\.AO index is obtained by projecting the AO loading pattern to the daily anomaly 1000 millibar height field over 20°N\-90°N latitude\. The AO loading pattern has been chosen as the first mode of EOF analysis using monthly mean 1000 millibar height anomaly data from 1979 to 2000 over 20°N\-90°N\.  |

| description | The Pacific Decadal Oscillation \(PDO\) is often described as a long\-lived El Niño\-like pattern of Pacific climate variability\. It is a pattern of Pacific climate variability similar to ENSO in character, but which varies over a much longer time scale\. The PDO can remain in the same phase for 20 to 30 years, while ENSO cycles typically only last 6 to 18 months\. The PDO, like ENSO, consists of a warm and cool phase which alters upper level atmospheric winds\. Shifts in the PDO phase can have significant implications for global climate, affecting Pacific and Atlantic hurricane activity, droughts and flooding around the Pacific basin, the productivity of marine ecosystems, and global land temperature patterns\. Experts also believe the PDO can intensify or diminish the impacts of ENSO according to its phase\. If both ENSO and the PDO are in the same phase, it is believed that El Niño/La Nina impacts may be magnified\. Conversely, if ENSO and the PDO are out of phase, it has been proposed that they may offset one another, preventing 'true' ENSO impacts from occurring |

A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 13\.5 million national and sub\-national administrative units, was used to assign UN WPP\-adjusted population counts to 30 arc\-second grid cells\. The density rasters were created by dividing the UN WPP\-adjusted population count raster for a given target year by the land area raster\. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc\-second \(~1 km at the equator\) resolution\. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc\-second adjusted count data were aggregated to 2\.5 arc\-minute, 15 arc\-minute, 30 arc\-minute and 1 degree resolutions to produce density rasters at these resolutions |

| description | This parameter is the amount of solar radiation \(also known as shortwave radiation\) that reaches a horizontal plane at the surface of the Earth\. This parameter comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation\. Radiation from the Sun \(solar, or shortwave, radiation\) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere \(aerosols\) and some of it is absorbed\. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface \(represented by this parameter\)\. To a reasonably good approximation, this parameter is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer \(an instrument used for measuring solar radiation\) at the surface\. However, care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box\. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted\. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour ending at the validity date and time\. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours ending at the validity date and time\. The units are joules per square metre \(J m\-2 \)\. To convert to watts per square metre \(W m\-2 \), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds\.
