# Events

The Earth System Data Lab is designed to support researchers by providing advanced tools and resources that streamline
their work and enhance collaboration. To promote awareness and encourage adoption, we actively showcase the platform at
key scientific conferences, where we engage with the research community and demonstrate its capabilities.

We also offer hands-on training sessions tailored to the needs of research groups and collaborative projects, ensuring
users can fully leverage the platform's features in their workflows. In addition, our online webinars provide accessible
opportunities for learning and engagement, with live demonstrations, expert guidance, and interactive Q&A sessions.

Through these activities, we aim to make the platform an integral part of the research ecosystem, empowering 
scientists to work more efficiently and collaboratively.

Take a look below to explore the events we've participated in so far.
