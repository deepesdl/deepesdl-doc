# Success Stories

Besides serving individual researchers, DeepESDL also operates as a comprehensive service platform for Earth Science 
projects. Teams benefit from  its ready-to-use infrastructure, covering computational resources for scalable data 
processing, collaborative and tailorable development environments, machine-learning tooling, and data visualization 
and dissemination services, to meet a wide range of technical needs. Its modular offer, which is available in 
the Network of Resources, enables each project to pick and configure only the components they require, from turnkey 
end-to-end solutions to individual services for specific tasks.

DeepESDL has been among the first platforms that integrated with ESA's emerging EarthCODE initiative for making key 
outputs of  research projects reusable and reproducible beyond the lifetime of the activities. To this end, the DeepESDL
team has developed tools and integrations to publish workflows encoded in Jupyter notebooks and the resulting datasets 
in the EarthCODE catalogue and potentially also in ESA's Project Results Repository (PRR). By implementing their 
research on DeepESDL, users can ensure that they meet ESA's requirements for a FAIR publication of results. 
The following projects have been or are still successfully doing research enabled by DeepESDL. 

## Projects

### Baltic AIMS

The BalticAIMS project set out to strengthen spatial planning across land and sea in the Baltic region by
helping planners coordinate actions that minimize human impacts and promote environmental health. It aimed to bring
together diverse environmental observations—such as satellite imagery, on-site measurements and model outputs—into a
unified perspective on coastal and terrestrial processes EO Science for Society. By delivering this integrated view, the project sought to deepen understanding of how land-based
activities affect coastal waters and vice versa, supporting more informed decisions.
Ultimately, BalticAIMS focused on enhancing the capacity of regional authorities and stakeholders to plan sustainably
for the interconnected land-sea system.

Baltic AIMS uses DeepESDL as a one-stop provider for all required cloud services, including compute, storage, 
data dissemination, and Viewer as a Service.

###  DeepExtremes

The DeepExtremes project aimed at an improved understanding of simultaneous heat and drought events around the world by
combining long-term climate records with satellite observations. To this end, key episodes have been examined in detail
by comparing affected regions with similar unaffected areas to uncover the patterns driving these compound extremes.
The project also sought to develop advanced methods to anticipate such events and share insights with the wider
research community.

A key result have been numerous so-called minicubes distributed all over the world containing relevant variables
from various soures. These minicubes have been generated within DeepESDL and will now be ingested into ESA's emerging
EarthCODE catalogue and then persisted in the ESA's novel Project Results Repository (PRR).

### ESA Science Hub courses

ESA's Science Hub is a facility at ESRIN dedicated to advanced earth system and climate science studies, serving as a
centre of excellence for scientific collaboration, networking, and exchange of ideas to address the major science
challenges of this decade. It promotes a community-driven response by boosting the scientific output of ESA and its
member states through access to ESA expertise, infrastructure, and resources that support innovative research efforts.
The Agency is regularly organizing Science Hub challenges, on site courses for students from universities and research
institutions of ESA member states.

DeepESDL has been supporting these events by providing a ready-to-use, collaborative development environment,
computational resources, and on-site expertise for the efficient implementation of scientific workflows into scalable
software.

### EO4HEALTH

The EO4Health Resilience project assesses how EO products can support public health decision-making, scenario analysis,
and impact and risk assessments by addressing scientific gaps and stakeholder needs to create a sustainable, long-term
initiative integrating EO into health resilience strategies. Leveraging ESA’s prior work, it develops services
using EO data to detect spatio-temporal patterns for predicting Vector-Borne Diseases (VBD) and Water-Borne Diseases (WBD).
The VBD service expands an Italian West Nile Virus model to cover North Africa and Europe, with outputs validated against
ground data, while WBD services refine models for cholera, E. coli, and Vibrio risks in areas like Vembanad Lake and the
Baltic Sea. A core component of the activity is the  “Resilience & Earth Observation Virtual Observatory” platform,
offering user-friendly access to EO and health data, enabling non-specialists to conveniently utilize the outcomes of the
project for their work.

The EO4Health Resilience project is using DeepESDL services to collaboratively develop workflows and to process and
integrate data sets. Moreover, the Virtual Laboratory has been implemented leveraging xcube viewer as a service,
specifically benefitting from its potential for extensions, customisation, and tailoring.

### EO-LINCS

EO-LINCS aims to lower the technological barriers for integrating Earth Observation (EO) data into carbon cycle research
by treating data production and scientific analysis as a unified system, co-designing bespoke data pipelines with scientific
and technical partners across four case-study sites. Its integrated approach spans data infrastructure, software engineering,
ground measurements, and carbon cycle modeling to evaluate how multiple EO datasets enhance understanding of net ecosystem
exchange, interannual variability, drought responses, and disturbance effects. By iteratively combining EO streams with
explainable machine‐learning within frameworks like FLUXCOM-X, EO-LINCS seeks to clarify key carbon fluxes and states,
ensuring EO products directly inform and improve carbon cycle science.

EO-LINCS uses DeepESDL as collaborative development environment for the science partners and for data access and processing.
For the project, the xcube library has been extended by a multistore, which enables users to easily create data cubes from multiple sources.

### WQ Forecasting

This project developed software that includes the forecast processor authored for the Forecasting Water Quality from 
Space study proposed by and granted to Brockmann Consult GmbH in reply to ESA's Invitation to Tender for Future EO-1 EO 
Science for Society Permanently Open Call for Proposals.

The objective of the study is to provide time series forecasts of chlorophyll concentration. 
Predicted chlorophyll concentration is derived from EO-based retrievals of chlorophyll concentration and 
several covariates, which are routinely provided by reanalysis and forecast services based on biological, 
chemical, physical, and meteorological models.
