# DeepESDL JupyterLab

## Basic usage

This section provides a brief introduction for users to the basic features of
the JupyterLab environment as offered by DeepESDL. 
For more in-depth documentation on the various components, see the links in the
section [Further Information](further-information.md).

### Logging in and starting the JupyterLab profile

To use the DeepESDL JupyterLab environment, navigate to
<https://deep.earthsystemdatalab.net/> with a web browser (a recent version of
Firefox, Chrome, or Safari is recommended).


Before first usage, we will have to register you with the system. Currently, 
we are not operational yet and still in testing phase. There is the 
possibility to register already as an Early Adopter. To this, we kindly ask you 
to write as an email at `esdl-support@brockmann-consult.de` and we will see 
if we can already onboard you.

DeepESDL uses a GitHub to authenticate, so if you are already registered as a 
DeepESDL user, please use your GitHub account to log in. 
If your Jupyter server is not already running, you may be presented
with a menu of user JupyterLab profiles to use for your session; there might be 
one or more JupyterLab profiles to choose from, depending on the computational 
resources needs of your team. Please select a suitable profile for 
your current task; it might not always require the profile with the strongest 
computational resources available.
After choosing your environment, you will see a progress bar appearing for a few 
moments while it is started for you. 
The JupyterLab interface will then appear in your web browser, ready for
use.


### Changing a JupyterLab profile

If you have already started your session and need to change the JupyterLab profile, 
you can do this by selecting *Hub control panel* from the *File* menu within
JupyterLab. Then click the `Stop my server` button and wait for your current
server to shut down. When the `Start my server` button appears, you can click
on it to return to the user JupyterLab profiles menu.

### Logging out

To log out, select *Log out* from the *File* menu within JupyterLab. 

Note that your JupyterLab session will continue in the background even after
you have logged out, but will eventually be terminated due to inactivity. 
If you wish to stop your session explicitly,
you can use the hub control panel as described in the 
[Changing a JupyterLab profile](#changing-a-jupyterlab-profile) section above.

### Python environment selection of the Jupyter Kernel

If you wish to use a special set of python packages, you can adjust it in the 
top right corner of the notebook. Next, a drop-down menu will appear, and you 
can select the desired kernel environment from it.
