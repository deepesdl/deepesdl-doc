[EarthCODE](https://esa-earthcode.github.io/documentation/Getting%20started%20with%20EarthCODE/) is 
a strategic initiative by the European Space Agency (ESA) to support Earth System Science through 
FAIR and Open Science practices. It offers researchers, particularly when executing ESA R&D projects, 
access to collaborative platforms with integrated tools, cloud infrastructure, and expert supportâ€”enabling more 
transparent, reusable, and impactful scientific work. Researchers are encouraged to publish workflows and data, 
developed on one of the supported ESA platforms or elsewhere, to the EarthCODE catalogue. By this means, 
other colleagues will be enabled to find, understand, and reproduce their research.

DeepESDL is supporting EarthCODE and both platforms have been fully integrated.

More specifically,

- the usage of DeepESDL for publishing in EarthCODE is sponsored by ESA through the Network of Resources.  
- A single sign-on (SSO) mechanism makes it convenient to work with both platforms 
- DeepESDL offers dedicated open-source tools to ensure an efficient and fully compliant publication process to EarthCODE. 

The main tool to achieve a seamless EarthCODE integration for our users is [`deep-code`](https://github.com/deepesdl/deep-code). 
It is a lightweight Python tool that offers a structured way to publish datasets and scientific workflows directly 
from DeepESDL to the EarthCODE platform. The tool includes both a command-line interface (CLI) and a Python API.

More information on how to use `deep-code` for publishing with DeepESDL and EarthCODE will be shared soon.
