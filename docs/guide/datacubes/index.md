# Data

DeepESDL provides a growing list of relevant variables for Earth System Science.
Most of them have been derived from Earth Observation, but the compilation also
includes model or re-analysis data if deemed useful.
DeepESDL is very grateful to all data owners for kindly providing the datasets
and allowing us to process, and redistribute them free of charge.
All data cubes generated and distributed by DeepESDL come without any warranty,
neither from the owners, from the DeepESDL, nor from ESA.

During ingestion into the DeepESDL, datasets are typically transformed in
space and
time to fit to the common grid of the data cube, a process that necessarily
modifies the original data. If you are looking for the original data, please
follow the links within the dataset attributes for each variable and contact
the data owners.


Data access is possible in two main manners within DeepESDL. [xcube
data stores](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataaccess.html#available-data-stores) 
provide [**on-demand**](on-demand) access to datasets via the data stores framework.
Other datasets are [**persisted**](pre-generated) in object storage for
fastest access.

An overview of all data sources can be found [**here**](../../data).
