The viewer contains public datasets only, but will later also provide user/team 
cubes when logged in. TThe login will be the same as for the DeepESDL JupyterLab.

For a more detailed description of the viewer functionality, please refer to a dedicated section in the
[xcube documentation](https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/viewer.html#functionality).
