Besides serving individual researchers, DeepESDL also operates as a comprehensive service platform for Earth Science 
projects. Teams benefit from  its ready-to-use infrastructure, covering computational resources for scalable data 
processing, collaborative and tailorable development environments, machine-learning tooling, and data visualization 
and dissemination services, to meet a wide range of technical needs. Its modular offer, which is available in 
the Network of Resources, enables each project to pick and configure only the components they require, from turnkey 
end-to-end solutions to individual services for specific tasks.

DeepESDL has been among the first platforms that integrated with ESA's emerging EarthCODE initiative for making key 
outputs of  research projects reusable and reproducible beyond the lifetime of the activities. To this end, the DeepESDL
team has developed tools and integrations to publish workflows encoded in Jupyter notebooks and the resulting datasets 
in the EarthCODE catalogue and potentially also in ESA's Project Results Repository (PRR). By implementing their 
research on DeepESDL, users can hence make sure to meet ESA's requirements for a FAIR publication of results. 
The following projects have been or are still successfully doing research enabled by DeepESDL:
