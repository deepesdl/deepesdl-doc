## Baltic AIMS 

The BalticAIMS project set out to strengthen spatial planning across land and sea in the Baltic region by 
helping planners coordinate actions that minimize human impacts and promote environmental health. It aimed to bring 
together diverse environmental observations—such as satellite imagery, on-site measurements and model outputs—into a
unified perspective on coastal and terrestrial processes EO Science for Society. By delivering this integrated view, the project sought to deepen understanding of how land-based 
activities affect coastal waters and vice versa, supporting more informed decisions. 
Ultimately, BalticAIMS focused on enhancing the capacity of regional authorities and stakeholders to plan sustainably 
for the interconnected land-sea system.

Baltic AIMS uses DeepESDL a one stop provider for all required cloud service including  compute. storage, data 
dissemination, and Viewer as a Service.

##  DeepExtremes 

The DeepExtremes project aimed at an improved understanding of simultaneous heat and drought events around the world by 
combining long-term climate records with satellite observations. To this end, key episodes have been examined in detail
by comparing affected regions with similar unaffected areas to uncover the patterns driving these compound extremes. 
The project also sought to develop advanced methods to anticipate such events and share insights with the wider 
research community.

A key result have been numerous so-called minicubes distributed all over the world containing relevant variables 
from various soures. These minicubes have been generated within DeepESDL and will now be ingested into ESA's emerging
EarthCODE catalogue and the persisted in the ESA's novel Project Results Repository (PRR).

## ESA Science Hub courses 

ESA's Science Hub is a facility at ESRIN dedicated to advanced Earth system and climate science studies, serving as a 
centre of excellence for scientific collaboration, networking, and exchange of ideas to address the major science 
challenges of this decade. It promotes a community-driven response by boosting the scientific output of ESA and its 
Member States through access to ESA expertise, infrastructure, and resources that support innovative research efforts.
The Agency is regularly organizing Science Hub challenges, on site courses for students from universities and research
institutions of ESA member states. 

DeepESDL has been supporting these events by providing a ready-to-use, collaborative development environment, 
computational resources, and on-site expertise for the efficient implementation of scientific workflows into scalable 
software.

## EO4HEALTH 

The EO4Health Resilience project assesses how EO products can support public health decision-making, scenario analysis,
and impact and risk assessments by addressing scientific gaps and stakeholder needs to create a sustainable, long-term 
initiative integrating EO into health resilience strategies. Leveraging ESA’s prior work, it develops services
using EO data to detect spatio-temporal patterns for predicting Vector-Borne Diseases (VBD) and Water-Borne Diseases (WBD).
The VBD service expands an Italian West Nile Virus model to cover North Africa and Europe, with outputs validated against 
ground data, while WBD services refine models for cholera, E. coli, and Vibrio risks in areas like Vembanad Lake and the 
Baltic Sea. A core component of the activity is the  “Resilience & Earth Observation Virtual Observatory” platform, 
offering user-friendly access to EO and health data, enabling non-specialists to conveniently utilize the outcomes of the 
project for their work. 

The EO4Health Resilience project is using DeepESDL services to collaboratively develop workflows and to process and 
integrate data sets. Moreover, the Virtual Laboratory has been implemented leveraging xcube viewer as a service, 
specifically benefitting from its potential for extensions, customisation, and tailoring.

## EO-LINCS 

EO-LINCS aims to lower the technological barriers for integrating Earth Observation (EO) data into carbon cycle research 
by treating data production and scientific analysis as a unified system, co-designing bespoke data pipelines with scientific
and technical partners across four case-study sites. Its integrated approach spans data infrastructure, software engineering,
ground measurements, and carbon cycle modeling to evaluate how multiple EO datasets enhance understanding of net ecosystem
exchange, interannual variability, drought responses, and disturbance effects. By iteratively combining EO streams with 
explainable machine‐learning within frameworks like FLUXCOM-X, EO-LINCS seeks to clarify key carbon fluxes and states,
ensuring EO products directly inform and improve carbon cycle science.

EO-LINCS uses DeepESDL as collaborative development environment for the science partners and for data access and processing. 
For the project, the xcube has been extended by a multistore, which enables users to easily create data cubes from multiple sources.
