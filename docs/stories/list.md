## Baltic AIMS 

The BalticAIMS project set out to strengthen spatial planning across land and sea in the Baltic region by 
helping planners coordinate actions that minimize human impacts and promote environmental health. It aimed to bring 
together diverse environmental observations—such as satellite imagery, on-site measurements and model outputs—into a
unified perspective on coastal and terrestrial processes EO Science for Society. By delivering this integrated view, the project sought to deepen understanding of how land-based 
activities affect coastal waters and vice versa, supporting more informed decisions. 
Ultimately, BalticAIMS focused on enhancing the capacity of regional authorities and stakeholders to plan sustainably 
for the interconnected land-sea system.

Baltic AIMS uses DeepESDL a one stop provider for all required cloud service including  compute. storage, data 
dissemination, and Viewer as a Service.

##  DeepExtremes 

The DeepExtremes project aimed at an improved understanding of simultaneous heat and drought events around the world by 
combining long-term climate records with satellite observations. To this end, key episodes have been examined in detail
by comparing affected regions with similar unaffected areas to uncover the patterns driving these compound extremes. 
The project also sought to develop advanced methods to anticipate such events and share insights with the wider 
research community.

A key result have been numerous so-called minicubes distributed all over the world containing relevant variables 
from various soures. These minicubes have been generated within DeepESDL and will now be ingested into ESA's emerging
EarthCODE catalogue and the persisted in the ESA's novel Project Results Repository (PRR).
