# Example Use Cases

This toolkit provides a series of tutorial notebooks designed to support geospatial data processing and machine learning
tasks on Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs). Key use cases include:

1. **[Land Surface Temperature Prediction](use_case_1.md)**: Demonstrates land surface temperature prediction. This serves as an introductory example for ESDC analysis.

2. **[Distributed Machine Learning](use_case_2.md)**: Showcases efficient preparation and training of large datasets on distributed systems.

3. **[Transfer Learning](use_case_3.md)**: Illustrates how to reuse pre-trained models for related tasks with limited data.

4. **[Cube Insights](use_case_4.md)**: Explores the characteristics of data cubes, helping inform preprocessing and modeling decisions.

5. **[Gap Filling](use_case_5.md)**: Provides techniques to fill missing data in remote sensing datasets using support vector regression (SVR).

6. **[ML for Multidimensional Samples with missing values](use_case_6.md)**: Demonstrates predictions on multidimensional data, utilizing simpler data imputation methods to address gaps.

Each of these use cases is accompanied by a corresponding Jupyter notebook/Python script, providing step-by-step
instructions, code examples, and visualizations to guide users through the entire workflow. Whether you're looking
to explore your data, fill gaps, or train machine learning models, this toolkit offers a set of resources to help
you achieve your goals.
