# Become a User

Whether you're working solo or as part of a team, this platform is designed to support your research needs.
Collaborate seamlessly, access powerful tools, and manage your Earth Sciences projects with ease—all in one place.


## How to Get Access

**Need funding?**

You can apply for support through the ESA Network of Resources (NoR),
which may cover the costs associated with using the platform. Check out the steps to help you through the 
application in the section below.

**Prefer a direct offer?**

If you'd like a tailored quote without applying through NoR, feel free to contact us
at `esdl-support@brockmann-consult.de`.

**Already Applied via NoR and Waiting?**

If your application is still under review, but you're eager to get started, reach out to us at
`esdl-support@brockmann-consult.de`—we’ll do our best to onboard you as soon as possible.
